Install the libraries from this link: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-5.0.4-windows-x64-installer

In the folder you will find the file "settings.json" - this is the program settings file.

There are several fields there.

1) ApiBotKey - telegram bot key. If you will be working with the current bot, then you can leave it alone.
2) SheetId - ID of your page in Google Sheet
3) Mode2 - enable / disable Mode 2 (from TK)
4) Users - an array of bot users' ID telegrams. The main user will always be the first on this list.

To get your ID, write to this bot: @chatid_echo_bot
